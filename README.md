## Welcome to Naki

This page (tries) to assemble all done works on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for native and indigenous languages of the American continent. Our languages are in danger, especially if they don't get involved in the new digital boom, that is introduced even into the most remote communities. Nevertheless, scientific and engineering work has been done on the field, ant this work wants to generate an (as much as possible) complete list. 

Our main aim is to encourage native speakers, researchers, and engineers to participate in this effort. Hopefully, we can do it with these survey.
